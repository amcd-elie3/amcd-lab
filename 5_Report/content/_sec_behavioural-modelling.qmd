# Behavioral Model Analysis using python

This sectio presents the behavioral analysis of the designed system using Python. The analysis primarily includes the **frequency response** (magnitude and phase response) and **transient analysis**.

---

## 1. Objective

To evaluate the performance of the behavioral model through simulation using Python, focusing on:

- Magnitude response
- Phase response
- Transient behavior

---

## 2. Frequency Response Analysis

### 2.1 Magnitude Response

The magnitude response of the system was plotted to observe how the system amplifies or attenuates input signals across different frequencies. The Bode magnitude plot gives a clear insight into the bandwidth and gain characteristics.

### 2.2 Phase Response

The phase response of the system was analyzed to study the phase shift introduced at various frequencies. This is essential for understanding the signal integrity and phase margin.
